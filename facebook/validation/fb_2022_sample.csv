Here‚Äôs the truth: Alexandria has delivered for her district in The Bronx and Queens. She fought for and won billions for Covid-19 funeral assistance after hearing from constituents about the painful economic toll of losing a loved one to Covid. She started an in-district tutoring program to help working parents amid lockdown and beyond, and even tutored a student herself. 

Alexandria stood with Starbucks workers as they fought to unionize, and skipped Biden‚Äôs inauguration to stand with produce workers in The Bronx who were protesting for living wages. And, she stood with taxi drivers to fight for justice after they were the targets of a predatory loan scheme. The truth is, Alexandria has always been laser focused on helping the working families of NY-14. 

Republicans and corporate interests can try to spread lies about our Congresswoman, but the fact stands that AOC has always and will continue to fight for us all.

And I‚Äôm fighting against the madness, to save Californians from living under these conditions.

But I need your help. 

Please consider donating $3, $5, or $10‚ÄìNo amount is too small!! 
=>https://go.briandahle.com/givenow-em

Here‚Äôs my pledge to you:
‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôll help, I promise I will work tirelessly to fix our education crisis by putting parents back in the driver seat.
‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôll help, I promise to implement economic policies that raise Californians out of poverty and preserve the California Dream.
‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôll help, I promise to support the rule of law, and you‚Äôll see the crime rates go down, not up.
‚Ä¢If you‚Äôll help, I promise to do everything in my power to make California affordable again. 

And my voting record supports it - so you know you can trust me to follow through.  

But none of this will be possible if we don‚Äôt reach our fundraising goals.  

Can I count on you to help out?

This is a huge moment for our movement ‚Äî this is the result of years of work by progressive advocates and activists that is going to improve so many people‚Äôs lives. 

I‚Äôve said it before and I'll say it again: Not every program has to be for everybody. People with apartments pay for first time homeowner benefits. Young people pay for Medicare for our seniors. People who take public transit pay for car infrastructure.

Maybe student loan forgiveness doesn‚Äôt impact you. That doesn‚Äôt make it bad. I am sure there are certainly other things that student loan borrowers‚Äô taxes pay for. We can do good things and reject the scarcity mindset that says doing something good for someone else comes at the cost of something for ourselves.

An example: If a person is blessed enough to be in a position to have paid off their loans, maybe they have a home now and benefitted from first-time homeowners‚Äô programs that people crushed by student loans help subsidize when they aren‚Äôt able to buy a home because of student debt. It all comes around. It‚Äôs okay. We can support things we won‚Äôt directly benefit from.

And another thing... we can keep pushing. Remember that the Biden administration didn‚Äôt want to do this *at all.* It was YOUR pushing, YOUR pressure, YOUR organizing that got them to this point. 

It is now up to us, and to you, to decide if we are going to stop here or if we are going to keep pushing. I am very grateful for this watershed moment of a first step ‚Äî it is encouraging, thrilling, and has already changed SO many people‚Äôs lives. But I am also thinking about how this still leaves a question mark for those in the highest amounts of debt, who need the most amount of help.

Growing up in Crest Hill, Harry‚Äôs parents both worked jobs. Both sides of his family raised children on union wages and benefits. Harry was taught to give back ‚Äî he and his parents volunteered at soup kitchens and brought meals and gifts to veterans.

Then, when Harry was 17 years old, everything changed. His mother underwent brain surgery, which resulted in a stroke necessitating round-the-clock care. This forced Harry‚Äôs father to spend most of their savings and refinance the equity from their home to pay for her care, nearly going broke while she was denied Medicaid for a year and a half.

Not long after she was approved, Harry‚Äôs dad was diagnosed with cancer, passing away when Harry was 20. He then became his mother's guardian, until her passing a few years later.

During an age in his life when most people are just starting to contemplate what options they have for the future, Harry was working two jobs and dealing with wealthy healthcare corporations to get his parents the right to see a doctor and being in a care facility without going bankrupt.
 
But Harry Benton has persisted. He‚Äôs an ironworker, a Plainfield village trustee, a husband and a father. And now he‚Äôs ready to help all of us ‚Äî by representing us in Springfield.

Maybe that‚Äôs why my tattoos are always the first thing people Google about me. So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.

On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill. 

On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths. 

My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint. 

Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.

I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.

We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.

Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and the honest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.

I‚Äôm told 3 of every 4 donations to our campaign are coming through the internet. So let me ask you, internet user, will you be one of the small-dollar donors that win us this Senate seat?

We have less than 6 weeks until this whole thing is over. If you‚Äôre ready to give it our all and win this Senate seat, please click the link below and chip in what you can to help us stay on track to flip Pennsylvania‚Äôs senate seat.",WMPID2065,"WMPID2065,WMPID1790"

For 4 straight weeks Dr. Oz + his allies have dominated the airwaves. Quite frankly, we‚Äôre getting nervous. Oz is using the GOP‚Äôs cash advantage to spread baseless lies about John... and it‚Äôs working.

The only way to fight back is with a BIG surge of grassroots donations so we can immediately ramp up our TV ads budget across PA more than ever before.

Please, rush a donation now to help us counter Dr. Oz‚Äôs lies, get more ads on the air, and keep reaching millions of PA voters. Closing this gap is critical to electing John + expanding our blue Senate majority.

That‚Äôs why we have released this new free online course, ‚ÄúAmerican Citizenship and Its Decline‚Äù. 

In this course, Victor Davis Hanson explains the meaning and history of citizenship and reveals how it is threatened today by progressive economic policies, widespread illegal immigration, the rise of tribal politics, an unaccountable deep state, and the loss of national sovereignty to global government.

Most importantly, you‚Äôll learn how to defend freedom by better understanding the role of a citizen and gaining insights into primary threats to free government.

This is not the usual campaign ad, but I think you‚Äôll find it interesting. Trust me. 

It was a classic sex for secrets case, and the biggest case of my career. That was until I investigated Donald Trump and presented the case at his first impeachment trial.

Before I go on (and I hope you‚Äôre going to want to read on), I want to ask you to chip in to my campaign, so I can continue holding Republicans, and anyone who seeks to undermine our democracy, accountable.

Richard Miller was an FBI agent assigned to the counterintelligence division (literally the bureau meant to combat Russian influence) in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. 

Miller was recruited by a Soviet emigree named Svetlana. After coming to the United States with her husband, she was disaffected with her new country and longed to go back to the USSR. But defectors were viewed as traitors by the Soviet Union and she had to earn her passage home. So she became a Russian intelligence asset, and Miller became her target. With marriage and financial difficulties, he was an easy mark. 

I‚Äôll spare you the details of their sordid dalliances, which were numerous. But eventually in 1984, Svetlana made her move, telling Miller the Russians would pay him for classified documents. Miller asked for tens of thousands in cash and gold. 

He drove up to San Francisco with Svetlana, and provided a Soviet intelligence officer at the Russian consulate with his FBI badge and a classified FBI counterintelligence manual to prove he could deliver. 

Things only escalated from there, but the FBI caught on to Miller and put him under surveillance. Miller discovered his surveillance and went to his superiors, and concocted an alibi that he was acting as a ‚Äúsecret double agent.‚Äù He was arrested, confessed, and then walked back the confession. Svetlana and her husband would later plead guilty.

Miller‚Äôs first trial was a mistrial, and his second was overturned on appeal. We had one more chance. That‚Äôs when I was brought into the case. At the time, I was about thirty and serving as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles.

It was my first blockbuster trial. And the pressure was immense.

I prepped for months, and during that time, I came into contact with dozens and dozens of FBI agents who had worked with Miller, but also investigated him. It was a crash course in the Bureau‚Äôs counterintelligence mission ‚Äî which I got to know even better many years later during my time at the Intelligence Committee, and while investigating Trump.

The Miller trial was in 1990, so of course they gave me a pretty early version of a cell phone ‚Äî it looked like the nuclear football, it was that big! I worked on the case all day and was on that big phone with agents all night.

The trial commenced less than a year after the Berlin Wall came down and just a couple of years before the Cold War finally ended. This is part of what I told the jury in my closing argument:

‚ÄúMiller had betrayed his job, his family, and the entire community that placed its trust in his hands ... this is a case of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order.‚Äù

The jury agreed, and the weight of the evidence was enough to convict him. Miller was found guilty, and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He would go down as the first FBI agent ever convicted of espionage. Sadly, he would not be the last. 

I learned a lot about the Russians during that investigation, the kind of people they target, their tradecraft, and the vulnerabilities they look for. They want people with access to information that is of use to them, and they look for people they can exploit ‚Äî with marital issues, or who are motivated by greed or resentment.  The Russians found a very, very good target with Richard Miller. 

I‚Äôve made it my mission in Congress to protect our country and our democracy, just as I did in the courtroom. 

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you to donate $10, or whatever amount is meaningful to you, today, so we can all do our part to protect our Democracy and hold those who seek to weaken or destroy it accountable.","","WMPID70,WMPID70,WMPID1290,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID233,WMPID1568,WMPID233"

""""Abuelo John... ¬øTienes un seguro de vida?"""" 

Me quedeÃÅ sorprendido por un momento, porque ¬øqueÃÅ clase de ninÃÉo de 7 anÃÉos hariÃÅa una pregunta tan atrevida? 

En lugar de responder, simplemente le pregunteÃÅ queÃÅ le haciÃÅa pensar en preguntarme eso. 

BajoÃÅ la cabeza un momento antes de mirarme y dijo...

"""" EscucheÃÅ a mi mamaÃÅ y a mi papaÃÅ hablar de ti y tienen miedo de que si te llega a pasar algo no tengamos el dinero para pagar el funeral""""

Pude ver que estaba preocupado. Le dije que todo estariÃÅa bien y que no habiÃÅa nada de queÃÅ preocuparse. 

La verdad es que no teniÃÅa nada para protegerlos si me pasaba algo y ellos tampoco tienen 10.000 doÃÅlares por ahiÃÅ para cubrir un gasto funerario repentino. 

Esa era mi responsabilidad. Una que auÃÅn no habiÃÅa asumido. 

VolviÃÅ de nuestro viaje el diÃÅa siguiente por la manÃÉana y llameÃÅ a mi amigo que es un Asegurador de Campo con licencia. Estuve a punto de pagar otro seguro y entonces me dijo que los residentes de Florida de entre 50 y 85 anÃÉos de edad tienen derecho a un NUEVO programa de entierro regulado por el Estado que estaÃÅ disenÃÉado para pagar nuestros gastos funerarios hasta 25.000 doÃÅlares libres de impuestos. 

Fue realmente sencillo. Me aprobaron casi al instante y ni siquiera les importoÃÅ que tuviera algunas condiciones de salud anteriores. 

No se requirioÃÅ ninguÃÅn anaÃÅlisis de sangre.

No hubo examen fiÃÅsico, ni citas con el meÃÅdico, ni requisitos invasivos. 

Me proveyeron cobertura desde el primer diÃÅa, incluso cubrieron a mi hermano que es diabeÃÅtico y que habiÃÅa sido rechazado para cobertura anteriormente. 

Gracias a este programa, pude decirle a mi nieto y a mi familia que todo estaraÃÅ bien cuando me pase algo.

My name is Luis Pozzolo. I'm an immigrant, small business owner, and proud American citizen. I'm running for U.S. Congress to bring common sense representation to the people of southern Arizona. I am committed to representing the people - not a political party or special interests.

I believe we should have policies that prioritize job creation and modern infrastructure in Southern Arizona. We ought to move towards energy independence and increase our domestic resource production. Additionally, I support policies that invite greater educational opportunity, make our neighborhoods safer, protect indigenous rights, take care of our veterans, and care for our seniors.

As a legal immigrant from Latin America, I believe we should follow the laws on our books. Also, we should increase efforts to fight against the fentanyl crisis.

I would be honored to earn your vote on November 8th.

Just in the last year alone, American homeowners have added over $1 TRILLION dollars in wealth due to their home equity, yet most of them don't know how to use that equity to their advantage. It's their money...why not claim it?

As more Americans learn about this amazing program, intelligent homeowners are starting to use this strategy to claim up to $87,221 to use towards home improvements, paying off debt, college educations for their children, or even just taking a dream vacation.

First, there is the Mason Dixon Poll, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SBsyjWWGhz74LyN0g1zQCHmFAzw7xQBT/view?usp=sharing that asked on Page 4 for Statewide Name Recognition of the Republican and Democratic Candidate. Next, the Poll asked the participants who they would vote for today. To me this creates an availability heuristic, a bias that favors the most recent things or people you have heard or seen. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic which discriminates against the non major political party candidates.

Second, the only news organization (I am not including the Palm Beach Post discussed below) to contact me and shared my information for information was News4Jax #news4jax #wjxt. See https://www.news4jax.com/voters-guide/2022/07/28/us-senate-from-florida/

Third, the Palm Beach Post on their Sunday Edition did an article on No Party Affiliate Voters and failed to include any information on No Party Affiliate Candidates, see https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/23/no-party-affiliated-voters-surge-palm-beach-county-becomes-purple/8122364001/. This is after I provided them with answers to their questionnaire https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5IoqebeIQ1NVZDBtutJnkxXnA_QMnlR/view?usp=sharing and interviewed for their editorial. The Editors decided to completely ignore my candidacy. https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/opinion/2022/10/21/palm-beach-post-florida-newspaper-endorses-val-demings-us-senate/8190795001/

**WHAT IS THE FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION?**

üèõ The Public Service Commission is made up of five Commissioners, all appointed by the Governor of Florida and approved by the Florida Senate. Gov. DeSantis has appointed 4 out of the 5 Public Service Commissioners.

üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Their job is to regulate the state‚Äôs utility companies: electricity, telephone, water, waste, etc. Their mission: ‚ÄúTo provide a regulatory process that results in fair and reasonable rates while offering rate base regulated utilities an opportunity to earn a fair return on their investments.‚Äù

üìà But lately, the PSC has approved some of the biggest electric rate hikes in Florida history. üçä

If you‚Äôre tired of the PSC rubber stamping these rate increases, send the commissioners an email using our action tool. (link in bio)

**WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASES?**

üìà Duke Energy estimates a 15.15% monthly rate increase
üìà Tampa Electric Company estimates a 10% monthly rate hike.
üìà FPL estimates a 7.9% monthly rate hike (for customers not in Northwest Florida).

In different times, parents and grandparents used to feel a mixture of excitement, anticipation and happiness. School was where children learned about themselves, formed friendships, and of course learned about the world.

Sadly, today it‚Äôs more complicated. Schools that were once a safe haven have been  infiltrated by dangerous and radical agendas that jeopardise our children's mental health, happiness and identity. 

The good news is, you can do something about it. Your child might get an education in school, but his aspirations, dreams and role models can be formed at bedtime with  stories that capture their heart. 

Less than a year ago we launched Heroes of Liberty with our children's souls in mind. We teach American values and life lessons by example, with beautiful art and engaging stories about the life of Heroes such as Ronald Reagan, Alexander Hamilton, John Wayne, Thomas Sowell, Mark Twain, Amy Coney Barret, Rush Limbaugh and Margaret Thatcher. 

Since we launched, our books have been praised on the Wall Street Journal, Fox and Friends, Megyn Kelly Show, The Daily Wire, Fox Business, Daily Caller, The Five, and in the education magazine Chalkboard Review, where former history teacher Steven Studer complained, ‚ÄúMy only issue with this series so far is the limited number of books available‚Äù.

Despite a long, tough road to recovery, King never lost hope. During years of recovery in the hospital, he earned his college degree, and he has gone on to compete in marathons and triathlons and become a published author. After all he has sacrificed, he is still proud to have served his country.

On Nov. 8, you'll vote on a constitutional amendment.

‚ÄúProposed Amendment to the 1970 Illinois Constitution ..."""" 

Amendment 1 for short. 

While this ballot question may not seem like a big deal, it could be one of the most consequential votes you ever cast. 

Why? 

The amendment, which only applies to government workers, could void more than 350 state laws, including discipline for government workers.

When government workers are no longer accountable to the citizens they serve ... our most vulnerable pay the price.

Look no further than the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. 

Over the last decade, more than 1,000 children who had contact with DCFS have died. 

If passed, Amendment 1 could eliminate mandatory background checks for DCFS workers.

And employment bans on adults deemed ‚Äúsexually dangerous‚Äù by the state.

It‚Äôs up to you to protect children from reckless state workers. 

Vote ‚ÄúNO‚Äù on Amendment 1.","",WMPID900

That means voters‚Äînot just politicians and judges‚Äîwill decide whether abortion care is protected in Michigan. And regardless of your political leanings, that‚Äôs good for ‚ÄòGanders.

Why?

Because it means you‚Äôll now have a direct say in November on how this issue should be decided in Michigan. And if the Reproductive Freedom For All initiative passes, those protections would be guaranteed under our state Constitution.

A 1931 state law makes it a crime to perform most abortions, but the law was suspended in May‚Äîand a judge this week followed up by striking it down as unconstitutional. Though appeals of that decision are likely, the law would be trumped if voters approve this amendment in the Nov. 8 election.

That means the future of reproductive freedom in Michigan‚Äîquite literally‚Äîis in your hands.

I was born in El Paso ‚Äî the community that Amy and I are lucky enough to be raising our three kids in. I started a small business here, creating good jobs and opportunities for people who call this city home. 

I spent seven years on the City Council, serving my community while working to make sure that our community was one where everyone could thrive.

I also represented El Paso in Congress for six years, where I fought for veterans, health care, and our public lands. 

In 2018, I ran for Senate ‚Äî and our campaign made history as one of the closest elections ever in Texas. We increased young voter turnout, organized everywhere across the state, and won more votes than any Democrat running for Senate in Texas ever had. Since 2018, I‚Äôve worked with organizers across the state to register tens of thousands of eligible voters and get more people involved in our democracy. 

Now, I‚Äôm running to be the next Governor of Texas and it couldn‚Äôt be happening at a more pivotal time. Our state is at a historic crossroads, and now more than ever, we need to deliver for the people of Texas ‚Äî great jobs, world-class schools, the ability to see a doctor, and the opportunity for everyone to live to their full potential. I need your help to make this happen in a state as big as Texas.

This video captures what's at stake in this November election, as the two Republican Commissioners are holding the line on Property Taxes and fighting crime as Jack has constantly spoken out against the insanity of releasing violent criminals over and over again on to our Streets. Watch it now!

The Leftist Progressive Socialist Majority wanted to release 4,000 felony inmates from the jail during COVID, stop all in-person instruction at our schools, awarded the most publicly corrupt contract I've ever seen (Elevate Strategies), and they even voted to defund our Constables... I could go on and on, but first they have to be stopped by re-electing Jack Cagle!

Jack has the common sense and the backbone to stand up to failed Leftist Progressive's public policy for what is right, and we can't afford to lose his special wisdom from decades of public service as a Judge and Commissioner.

James Carville here: I‚Äôve got almost 50 years of experience working on political campaigns, and I'm telling ya, we‚Äôre at a make-or-break moment in this one. 

I just took a look at the latest polling out of Nevada, and it shows Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto LOSING by a point to her Trump-endorsed opponent. Clearly the $22 MILLION Mitch McConnell and his allies are pouring into vicious, lying attack ads is working.

Look, I ain‚Äôt gonna sugarcoat this: If we lose Nevada, we can kiss our 50-50 Senate majority goodbye. That means two years of watching McConnell BLOCK progress and stomp all over our rights. It‚Äôs a nightmare that is dangerously close to becoming our reality ‚Äì unless we ALL step up to help Catherine fight back.

What we do RIGHT NOW is going to decide the Senate majority, so I‚Äôm personally asking YOU to chip in to help Catherine raise the $6,235 she needs by MIDNIGHT to keep Nevada and the Senate blue: Can I count on you to rush a donation at this critical moment and help save the Senate?

This is, of course, an exaggeration, but it makes clear the far-Left‚Äôs goal‚Äînothing less than a transformation of the world economy based on a rejection of economist Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible hand.‚Äù

As the author writes, ‚ÄúWe are on the cusp of a new era of broad-based prosperity in which our leaders are poised to more actively manage the American market.‚Äù

Today‚Äôs advocates of a ‚Äúmanaged market‚Äù may call it by a new name‚Äî‚ÄúThe Great Reset‚Äù‚Äîbut it is premised on an old and harmful idea.

What utopian ideologies like this one have in common is a misplaced faith in the rule of so-called experts and a corresponding disregard for the people‚Äôs right to rule themselves. Taken to their logical conclusion, such ideologies can end only in tyranny.

In the fight to preserve our freedom, our greatest asset is education. Americans who understand our country‚Äôs founding principles and have a firm grasp of history are best prepared to resist the lure of utopian schemes.

That‚Äôs why Hillsdale College is asking today if you will take a few minutes to participate in our FREE MARKET SURVEY.

According to Rachel Maddow and CNN, Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire has one of the most vulnerable Senate seats in the country ‚Äì and now that we're in the election year, it's crucial that we raise every dollar we can to defeat Mitch McConnell and protect the Senate from the GOP. 

If we let Republicans take back the Senate, that means giving up all our hard-earned efforts for reproductive rights, climate change and voting rights. In the past year, Republicans have introduced over 425 bills across the country systematically dismantling our access to the ballot box, and they will stop at nothing until they've wrested back control by any means necessary. Our democracy is at stake, friend, and we cannot pass legislation guaranteeing the right to vote if we lose control of the Senate. 

Every grassroots donation will help us in our fight against McConnell and the GOP this election year, but it looks like yours is still missing.

In approximately four minutes, he shot 154 bullets, killing 20 children and six educators. Five of those bullets hit Dylan, and in an instant, my little boy was gone.

But in the time it took the shooter to reload, 11 children were able to escape. If the sale of military-style assault weapons had been prohibited, just think how many more children could have survived. Perhaps Dylan would still be alive today. Perhaps more people would have escaped from the horrific mass shootings in Parkland, Boulder and so many other communities.

That's why I'm trying to gather 100,000 petition signatures demanding Congress make it illegal to purchase an assault weapon. But we're still several thousand signatures short of our goal, and it looks like you haven't signed yet. So please, sign the petition right now to help save lives.

Michiganders will soon have easier access to birth control‚Äîand more freedom to plan their own families‚Äîas a result of an executive directive from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

Here‚Äôs the deal:

Before Roe v. Wade was overturned in June, Whitmer asked state departments and agencies to identify ways they could protect the reproductive freedoms of Michiganders.

This week, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs announced that pharmacists will soon be able to prescribe birth control options like oral contraceptives, the patch, and the ring. Right now, Michiganders can only get birth control from a doctor. The new program, however, allows pharmacists to partner with doctors and an oversight process to safely and conveniently prescribe birth control themselves.

Nearly 30% of women in the US say they face barriers when trying to get or refill birth control, so helping Michiganders access that key part of family planning could be a game-changer.

Pharmacists don‚Äôt have to participate. If they do, however, they‚Äôll join colleagues across the country who are part of similar programs. Michigan‚Äôs now one of 20 other states and the District of Columbia to offer the pharmacist-physician contraceptive partnership.",WMPID5328,WMPID5328

Less than an hour after I was declared the Democratic nominee for Senate in Iowa, the attacks from Chuck Grassley began.

‚ÄúThe most liberal nominee in Iowa Senate history‚Äù
‚ÄúRadical‚Äù
‚ÄúSocialist‚Äù

Gotta love it!

Chuck Grassley doesn‚Äôt know what to say about me. He‚Äôs never faced an opponent like me before. I‚Äôm his political nightmare, so he‚Äôs just throwing cow pies at the wall and hoping something sticks.

Calling me ‚Äúradical‚Äù is laughable when Chuck Grassley supports a complete ban on abortion and letting literally anyone buy an AR-15 without even a background check. But there‚Äôs one attack that I absolutely won‚Äôt take lying down, and that‚Äôs Chuck Grassley‚Äôs attacking me for serving our country for 36 years in the U.S. Navy.

Grassley is already trying to say that because I enlisted in the military at age 19, because my deployments meant that my family had to move from state-to-state and country-to-country... that I‚Äôm not an Iowan anymore.

Chuck Grassley wants to pretend that I wasn‚Äôt raised in rural, northwest Iowa. He ignores the enormous sacrifices that my family ‚Äì my wife and my kids ‚Äì made to allow me to serve in the Navy.

Grassley‚Äôs attacks denigrate every servicemember and every military family that has to pack up, change schools, say goodbye to friends, spend holidays away from each other, and be absent from life‚Äôs big events like weddings and the birth of a child.

And if Chuck Grassley thinks that I will stand silent while he says that every Iowan who puts on our country‚Äôs uniform stops being an Iowan... he‚Äôs delusional.

These are the kinds of attacks I‚Äôm going to be up against. Nasty stuff from Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, and the Fox ‚ÄòEntertainment‚Äô News propaganda network.

There‚Äôs one reason why: The GOP is scared. They‚Äôve seen the polls, and they know that if we defeat Grassley and turn Iowa blue this November, Democrats are guaranteed to maintain our Senate majority.

In order to fight back, we need to raise $250,000 before our mid-month deadline at midnight tonight, but the only way we‚Äôll hit our goal and send Grassley packing is if grassroots donors like you give right now:

Please, can I count on you to give $10 or more right now ‚Äì every dollar you can afford ‚Äì to help me defeat Chuck Grassley, turn Iowa blue, and protect our Democratic Senate majority?

It‚Äôs me ‚Äì Al Franken! ‚Äì interrupting your feed to hit you up for a donation to help elect Senator Franken.

Just to be clear: I‚Äôm not running for Senate (not right now anyway).

No. I‚Äôm talking about Admiral Mike Franken, the Democrat running for Senate in Iowa against the spineless fossil known as Chuck Grassley.

As far as we can tell, Mike and I are not related. But we‚Äôve got a whole lot else in common.

He‚Äôs a retired three-star Admiral who commanded destroyers, fought pirates, and oversaw covert ops in the U.S. Navy.

Okay. I did none of that.

But I‚Äôm a comedy writer who wrote books about Republicans who don‚Äôt tell the truth. And I remember back in 2009, after we Democrats in the Senate had introduced the Affordable Care Act, Chuck Grassley flat out lied about it. He said, referring to the so-called ‚Äúdeath panels,‚Äù that the ACA would determine ‚Äúwhen you pulled the plug on grandma.‚Äù

Grassley had to walk that back. But then he voted against the ACA. And did so repeatedly, year after year. But finally, after learning that Americans and Iowans overwhelmingly like the health care coverage they get under the Affordable Care Act, Grassley has pledged NOT to vote to change it!

Mike Franken is a man of integrity. And he‚Äôs got a real shot at defeating Chuck. But this race could be as close as my first one was. And that other spineless fossil, Mitch McConnell, and his Super PAC buddies are going to drop millions to try to win it.

If Mike Franken is going to follow in my footsteps and become the next Senator Franken, he needs people like you to chip in to his campaign today:

I‚Äôm personally asking you to give $10 now (or whatever amount your heart desires) to Mike‚Äôs campaign to help him defeat Chuck Grassley this November and protect Democrats‚Äô majority in the Senate.

Control of the Senate is at stake ‚Äì and our democracy is on the ballot.

On behalf of the entire Franken clan, thank you.

Independent voters are breaking toward Demings by 13 points, 50% vs 37%. This is GREAT! But Rubio holds a significant lead in name recognition: 94% of likely general election voters know him. For a newcomer like Demings, that number is 67%.

Bottom line: When independents learn about Demings, more break her way. If we make her a household name, there‚Äôs a clear path to victory in Florida. But Florida is a large state and we‚Äôll need to spend a lot more money on advertising to get there. And unlike Rubio, our limiting factor isn‚Äôt our candidate but resources.

So, can you donate to our campaign today? We‚Äôll need to raise a minimum of $250,000 online every day until Election Day.

The key to your home equity can be gone before you even know it, thanks to cybercriminals taking out mortgages on your house (after putting the title in their name) and leaving you with the bill üëÄ

Title insurance doesn't cover you like you might think it does.

Home Title Lock monitors this activity 24/7 so you can protect your nest egg.

What would losing your home's equity mean for your quality of life?","",WMPID1969

Even if hidden beneath the surface, why is it important for us to care about life in the oceans Before it Disappears? Did you know that Ocean Ecosystems are 5-10x more effective at sequestering carbon than land ecosystems? We have that very same ocean ecosystem to thank for every other breath we take!

Maybe that‚Äôs why my tattoos are always the first thing people Google about me. So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.

On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill. 

On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths. 

My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint. 

Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.

I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.

We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.

Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and the honest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.

I‚Äôm told 3 of every 4 donations to our campaign are coming through the internet. So let me ask you, internet user, will you be one of the small-dollar donors that win us this Senate seat?

We have just a couple days until this whole thing is over. If you‚Äôre ready to give it our all and win this Senate seat, please click the link below and chip in what you can to help us stay on track to flip Pennsylvania‚Äôs senate seat.",WMPID2065,"WMPID2065,WMPID1790"

With Roe gone, Catherine Cortez Masto is the only person standing in the way of Mitch McConnell and a national abortion ban. And she‚Äôs coming up on her FINAL FEC quarterly deadline of the election!

That‚Äôs why I need you to see this: A group of donors is triple-matching all gifts up to $100,000 for Sen. Cortez Masto‚Äôs crucial midnight fundraising deadline!

This isn't the kind of offer that happens every day, but it‚Äôs happening because the stakes of Catherine's race couldn‚Äôt be higher. CNN and The New York Times just named Catherine the most vulnerable senator in the entire country, and polling shows her trailing her extremist opponent by a single point. If she loses, anti-choice extremists WILL take control of our Senate. 

The Washington Post just reported that Catherine is the GOP‚Äôs #1 target, which explains the tens of millions of dollars they‚Äôre spending on attack ads to defeat her. What we do right now will determine whether she will have the resources to fight back. So today, I‚Äôm personally asking you: Will you rush a TRIPLE-MATCHED donation now to make sure Catherine can fight back and save our Democratic Senate majority?

Maybe that‚Äôs why my tattoos are always the first thing people Google about me. So before I ask you to make a donation to my campaign for U.S. Senate, let me tell you more.

On my left arm I have the zip code 15104. That‚Äôs Braddock, PA, my home and the community I was honored to serve as Mayor for 13 years. Gisele and I are raising our kids here in Braddock, right across the street from Andrew Carnegie‚Äôs first steel mill. 

On my right arm I have nine different dates. These represent the dates of people who were killed through violence in Braddock while I served as mayor, starting in 2006. Seven out of nine were gun deaths. 

My first tattoo came after January 16, 2006. It was my second week on the job as mayor after winning my election by a single vote. I received a call and was summoned to a police crime scene where a pizza delivery man had been robbed and killed at gunpoint. 

Every time Braddock lost someone was the worst feeling in the world. In a close-knit community like Braddock, it‚Äôs very likely that you know the victim and their family. It‚Äôs an incredibly wrenching and personal experience as a mayor ‚Äî but nothing compared to what the families have to go through.

I worked with the community to take on gun violence and other important issues that Braddock faced every day. I helped initiate youth and art programs for the students of our community and we worked together to create a community center.

We also worked to develop buildings that had been written off, kick-started our economy, and reduced deadly violence. My proudest moment as Mayor of Braddock was when our community went 5 1‚ÅÑ2 years without a gun-related death.

Now I‚Äôm running for U.S. Senate, and thehonest truth is that we still need to raise a lot of money to take down my self-funding opponent, Dr. Oz, and his band of celebrity grifters.

I‚Äôm told 3 of every 4 donations to our campaign are coming through the internet. So let me ask you, internet user, will you be one of the small-dollar donors that win us this Senate seat?

We have less than 10 weeks until this whole thing is over. If you‚Äôre ready to give it our all and win this Senate seat, please click the link below and chip in what you can to help us stay on track to flip Pennsylvania‚Äôs senate seat.",WMPID2065,"WMPID2065,WMPID1790"

Here is an example of what that roadmap can look like... 

(More info on each element in the coming weeks, but each one is supported by a strong majority of Iowans, and over and over again these are the issues we hear about the most on the phone and at the doors)

Lower Costs
- Wages aren't keeping up with rising costs
- Prioritize working families to big corporations
- Expand access to affordable housing & childcare

Protect Reproductive Freedom
- Private health care decisions belong to you, your family, and your doctor - not the government
- The Governor and Republicans are trying to pass a ban on ALL abortions, despite 60% of Iowans believing it should be LEGAL in most cases

Invest in Public Schools
- Revitalize our public schools to guarantee quality education across the state
- Restore collective bargaining rights and raise educator salaries to remain competitive
- Stop the highly unpopular school vouchers plan

Legalize Marijuana
- Stop our tax revenue going to neighboring states
- Improve quality of life for those suffering a chronic illness
- Provide safer options to unregulated marijuana and opioids","",""

With Roe gone, Catherine Cortez Masto is the only person standing in the way of Mitch McConnell and a national abortion ban.

That‚Äôs why I need you to see this: A group of donors is triple-matching all gifts up to $100,000 for Sen. Cortez Masto‚Äôs crucial midnight fundraising deadline!

This isn't the kind of offer that happens every day, but it‚Äôs happening because the stakes of Catherine's race couldn‚Äôt be higher. CNN and The New York Times just named Catherine the most vulnerable senator in the entire country, and polling shows her trailing her extremist opponent by a single point. If she loses, anti-choice extremists WILL take control of our Senate. 

The Washington Post just reported that Catherine is the GOP‚Äôs #1 target, which explains the tens of millions of dollars they‚Äôre spending on attack ads to defeat her. What we do right now will determine whether she will have the resources to fight back. So today, I‚Äôm personally asking you: Will you rush a TRIPLE-MATCHED donation now to make sure Catherine can fight back and save our Democratic Senate majority?

Here's what we have to show for his failed governorship:

‚óè Gas prices have nearly doubled.

‚óè Food has become extremely expensive due to his over regulation of our supply chain.

‚óè Utilities have skyrocketed because of a mismanaged power grid.

‚óè Rent and home purchases have become too expensive because of ‚Äòred-tape‚Äô on new construction.

Who can possibly afford 4 more years of Newsom?

These days, middle class citizens are having to decide between filling their gas tank, or putting food on the table.

This has to stop. 

California CAN be affordable - we simply have to change the progressive policies that are driving people out.

As your new Governor...

I will lower the cost of gas.

I will lower the cost of food.

I will lower the cost of housing.

I will lower the cost of your energy bills.

Bottom line: I want you to be able to afford living in California.

That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm going to be hard at work in the nation‚Äôs Capitol.

But I wanted to take a moment to tell you how I‚Äôve prepared for big hearings and big moments during my time in Congress.

You might remember a few years ago when I was in the middle of impeachment hearings for President Donald Trump. Well, I wanted to take you inside what it‚Äôs like.

Every Member prepares differently, but I start by reviewing the evidence. That means reading transcripts of interviews and depositions ‚Äî often hundreds or thousands of pages ‚Äî watching video evidence, listening to recordings, and reviewing exhibits. 

My next step is to outline. What are my objectives? What evidence am I hoping to highlight? What moments are most important for the public to see?

And then, I write. I write a lot. I think it‚Äôs important to write and speak in my own voice. That‚Äôs what people expect.

After all of that, I prepare with staff. Again, a lot. We go over the videos and evidence. And then do it again. And again.

Then, when the hearing begins, I set all that preparation aside and listen to what the witnesses have to say, looking for something unique, a new insight that I can draw upon in follow-up questions. I try not to be so wedded to a script that I miss what is truly important. You would be surprised how often that happens.

It‚Äôs long and arduous work. But it‚Äôs worth it. Because hopefully, the end result is something that really connects with the American people, and is deeply meaningful.

So, as I begin a busy month in DC, I hope that I can continue to convince people of the same things that I have always thought were important: That what is right still matters. That the truth matters. And that decency matters.

Because it does. And it always will. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking for a donation, so I can focus on the work at hand, protecting our democracy.",WMPID628,"WMPID70,WMPID70,WMPID70,WMPID1290"

We‚Äôve done something we‚Äôve never done in our 23-year history: We‚Äôre running a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop Donald Trump from replacing the top election officials in battleground states with his loyalists in this November‚Äôs midterm elections‚Äîand this has sent Fox News and the Republican Party scrambling. 

""""Sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,"""" Trump stated at a rally this year. That explains Trump‚Äôs plan for the 2024 election‚Äîand if it works, the voters will not decide the election‚Äôs outcome. 

The upcoming midterm elections are a critical time for Trump and his allies to are methodically working to place Trump's most ardent supporters‚Äîall who spout his Big Lie of a stolen election‚Äîin secretary of state offices of battleground states. In most states, secretaries of state oversee vote counting, have the power to certify (or decertify!) election results, and declare election winners and losers. 
That‚Äôs why MoveOn‚Äôs all-out work to fight Trump‚Äôs efforts this November and protect our elections has hit a nerve with Fox News and the GOP. A GOP spokesperson responded to MoveOn's campaign by saying the GOP will """"accelerate our fundraising efforts so we can stop them.""""

This is worrying: If we allow Republicans, their billionaire donors, and dark-money groups to steamroll our efforts with their fundraising, Trump's plot to use secretaries of state to install him to another term as president might just work.

The midterm elections are approaching fast. Will you start a donation now to power our campaign to defeat Trump-backed secretaries of state and safeguard our democracy?

Why?

·Ö†üëâ Figuring out the Social Security System is hard

·Ö†üëâ Filing decisions are complex and based on health, savings and marital history

·Ö†üëâ Many consult a neighbor or friend, whose situation is completely different


·Ö†·Ö†""""You think taxes are complicated?
·Ö†·Ö†Try figuring out Social Security benefits.‚Äú
·Ö†·Ö†·Ö†- üìí  Forbes Magazine


A huge government system like this has to be complex enough to serve hundreds of millions of Americans, so understanding the right retirement options FOR YOU is not easy.

The Social Security handbook has more than 2,700 entries on everything from remarriage to black lung benefits, so Americans never get fully informed before they file.

And Social Security Office employees are actually restricted from giving you advice, so there‚Äôs not much help there.

There are so many options, and the consequences of making the wrong decision can leave you stuck with a bad choice for years..

Last year alone, more than 13 million households received lower payments than they deserved because of just one bad choice.

There is no one size fits all approach - everyone‚Äôs situation is different.

That‚Äôs why we're holding this ground-breaking presentation:

	Maximizing Social Security in Wild Times 

In this seminar, attended by thousands all over the country, we are opening eyes and shocking audiences with knowledge like:

·Ö†üëâ Your Social Security proceeds are taxable, unless you do one simple thing

·Ö†üëâ 3 strategies to help you and your spouse know when to file

·Ö†üëâ How the new rules of Social Security apply to you


You‚Äôve worked a lifetime to earn your Social Security - make sure you get all that‚Äôs coming to you.

Folks, please stop letting them manipulate you into voting for them.  Is that really the kind of Governor you want leading our state?  A leader who uses voter scare tactics just to get elected? 

This is the first real chance Oklahoma has ever had to elect an Independent Governor.  

If we really want to change 
It starts by changing who we‚Äôre voting for!

For 115 years the Republicans and Democrats have controlled our state.
And where are we for it? 
We‚Äôre at the bottom of every single category that matters to us
From education to healthcare
And all the while 
The wealthiest among us continue to get wealthier 
While Oklahoma‚Äôs poverty rate continues to rise

But hope is on the horizon 
Because on November 8th Oklahomans will get to choose a new Governor 
A Governor who will represent the people of Oklahoma

Please join the 410,000 registered Independents in Oklahoma this year
And vote for the only truly Independent candidate on the ballot for Governor
The only one who hasn‚Äôt taken a single dollar from any major party!
The only one who will represent the people of Oklahoma and not a political agenda
 
VOTE YEN for Governor on November 8th 
Isn‚Äôt it time we put people over politics?

I'm running for Congress because I see my neighbors falling behind. Our Congressman has represented this community for over 26 years and things have only gotten worse. He's given contracts to his friends and family while ordinary people like you and me struggle to get by, living paycheck to paycheck.

It's time to fight for our community, not corporations and special interests. It's time to use power to bring good jobs, living wages, healthcare, education, and a brighter future for our children. It's time for a government that works hard for US.

Our election is November 8th and I hope that you will join us in this fight. Donate, volunteer, and vote by November 8th.

Well, as I previously posted, I came to the Port Commission newly elected in 2018 and found that the Chairman did not live here.(see previous post).
Realizing that our Republic had literally been hijacked by this interloper and no help in sight, I continued on to some more of this.....

I posted my public official bond of $5k as required by the Port charter which was issued to me at my first meeting.  The Charter also required the Port secretary to reimburse me the cost of the bond which was $340.  Instead, the other Port Commissioners, Way, Brown and Rivers, took a vote to keep my money.

The Charter also dictated that any commissioner who did not get their public official bond """"shall vacate their office"""".
When I advised them all of the charter's demand, they scoffed and refused to comply with the law.   Commissioner West was not on the board at this time.

Right after that, it became apparent that the $2.9 dollar dredge contract at Summer Haven was woefully incomplete.  Long story short, there was no bid on a $376 thousand dollar engineering contract, it was given away.  The subcontractor came to the job without state required insurance.  Just to mention a few.  It's just a few chips off the iceberg in the Summer Haven catastrophy.  End of the day, false statements were made,  the project was unfinished and the lack of oversight cost the tax payers $978K  in FEMA grant money ($886k + $92k)  

The contractors were liable, I called an emergency meeting and asked the other Commissioners to file a claim to recoup the tax payer's dollar which had been illegally squandered.  All commissioners voted yea.  Ultimately they all back peddled from this action and did nothing.  I complained bitterly for two years about following that public mandate, to no avail.  

There is a Pat Conroy novel here that could explain all of politics in Florida.  Glad to discuss it in more detail with anyone.  

Needless to say, you don't talk about 32 year long engineering contracts and projects that are never completed but paid in full without expecting some backlash.

The backlash came in the form of character defamation and collusion between the Port Attorney, Clay Meek (specially chosen to get rid of me) and the Director of General services for City of St Augustine, Jim Piggott.

  Again, the story is too long, but in a nutshell, the two of them and a few others, pulled off a smear campaign against me. 

 The Port Attorney used a hand written piece a notebook paper, sent to the Port anonymously ,no official anything to even indicate that it came from the City or it's police department, to place an item on the Port agenda to discuss the possibility of filing a complaint with the Florida Ethics Commission against me for using a racial slur. 

 The fact is, however, that the racial slur never happened and the Ethics Commission told me directly that they would reject any complaint based on such a claim.  They informed me that they are not the morality police and have a very narrow scope of interest which is primarily concerned with funneling money into the pockets of your family and businesses that you profit from.  So any attorney worth their salt would certainly be able to tell the difference in what is a Ethics complaint and what is not an Ethics complaint. 

 But Port attorney Meek was not really interested in his complaint being rejected.  He and Mr. Piggott were out for me.  Turns out, Jim Piggott was the only one who took receipt of that fictitious, anonymous police report.  I interviewed Chief Fox and his records department carefully to obtain this data.
  Did I mention, the Port Attorney did all of this before he even bothered to sign his contract with the Port.  When I asked him who advised him  to waste tax payer's dollars on a project without board approval, he told me """" Chairman Brown"""" told him to do it.  
Alrighty then, wish I had never voted for Chairman Matt Brown or campaigned for him or nominated him as chairman.    Good ole boy crosses all party lines.    Another book here all by itself but I invite you to view their handiwork in the St Augustine record at
https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/2020/10/23/allegations-against-port-waterway-commissioner-prompt-ethics-question/3720327001/

Needless to say, they didn't expect me to defend myself.  I am from South Carolina.  They should have known better.

Follow up post on its way!  I have a lot more to say!
This is why I am running again with folks that I know have solid common sense and direct knowledge of Port operations.....Melanie Sunshine Neal and Michelle Bennett.  My hands are tied without a quorum of common sense.

Disclaimer:. Commissioner West missed much of this fun .  Hopefully we can all move forward fully informed about the past actions of the St Augustine Port ,Waterways & Beach Commission.

Yet, over half of Americans are in the middle with only a slight lean to the left or right. 

Part of the reason we feel this way is because of the reactions we get whenever we share anything about our political feelings. If we say so much as one thing that is left leaning, then we may be called a socialist commie and so on and so forth. If we say something that is right leaning, then we may end up labeled a traitorous fascist.

Are there people in our country with far left and far right views? You bet.

Are the majority of Americans on the far ends of the political views? Absolutely not.

There are plenty of organizations for people who feel like they need to dig in and fight against ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù that is a threat to our country. CommonSense American was formed for the rest of us. The majority of us. Those who still believe Americans can disagree and still equally love our country.

IF YOU REALLY WANT THINGS TO CHANGE
IT STARTS WITH CHANGING WHO WE ELECT INTO OFFICE

Jan. 6 wasn't an isolated incident. It was a dress rehearsal. It will happen again.

In fact, it's already happening in slow motion right in front of us, with Trump's election deniers running to take over the offices that count votes and will certify the results of the 2024 election. Some dangerous examples:

In Arizona, the GOP candidate for secretary of state is Mark Finchem, a QAnon-supporting member of the white supremacist Oath Keepers militia, who participated in the January 6 insurrection. He won the GOP primary by claiming that Trump won the 2020 election.

In Michigan, the GOP candidate for secretary of state is Big Lie proponent Kristina Karamo, who rose to conservative prominence after falsely claiming to have witnessed election fraud as a pollster.

There are many more Big Liars running to control our elections‚Äîand they terrify me. If any one of them wins in a battleground state, they could tip the balance to Trump in a tight presidential election. What terrifies me even more is that they could tip America away from democracy to authoritarianism.

MoveOn has a long track record of turning out voters, and I'm so impressed by their focus on these secretary of state races. They understood early on that these races, while much lower profile than other races, are absolutely critical to stopping the Republicans' next coup.

But I heard from the MoveOn team that their fundraising is behind in these critical final weeks before Election Day. Will you chip in to power MoveOn‚Äôs work to defeat Trump-backed secretary of state candidates and protect our democracy?‚Äù

I‚Äôm joining a group of top Democrats to personally TRIPLE-MATCH all gifts up to $100,000 for Catherine's critical midnight deadline!

If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm doing something this nuts, it‚Äôs because what we do RIGHT NOW will decide the future of our country. Our Democratic Senate majority is now our LAST line of defense for women's rights. And there ain't no chance in hell we can defend the Senate if Catherine loses in Nevada!

CNN just named Catherine the most vulnerable Democrat in the country, and Mitch McConnell and his allies are spending over $34 MILLION to flip Nevada red. So if Catherine misses her goal, our chances of holding the Senate are DEAD.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm counting on you to rush a TRIPLE-MATCHED donation to save our Senate majority. I need you to join me in the fight at this critical moment: Please donate before the midnight deadline and have your gift go THREE TIMES as far!""""

All it takes is you actually showing up, and telling your friends and family to show up and vote too. 

Here‚Äôs what you saw in the last 4 years with Gavin Newsom. 

‚óè Gas prices more than doubled. 
‚óè Our crime rate skyrocketed.
‚óè People left our state in mass exodus because they couldn‚Äôt afford to live here.
‚óè Our children‚Äôs education standards sunk to nearly the lowest in the nation.

‚óè He asked you to ration your water every summer. 
‚óè Our forests burned out of control.

A vote for me is a vote for safer communities.
 
A vote for me is a vote to solve California‚Äôs water shortage.
 
A vote for me is a vote for implementing real solutions to the homelessness crisis.
 
A vote for me is a vote to transform our schools into the best in the nation.
 
A vote for me is a vote for bringing back integrity and transparency to Sacramento.
 
A vote for me is a vote for restoring the California Dream.

A vote for me is a vote to properly steward our natural resources to mitigate devastating wildfires.
 
And this is the important part - I have the record to prove it.
 
My work in the Legislature speaks for itself, and when I bring my record to the office of the Governor, California will truly change for the better. 
 
So please, it‚Äôs imperative that you turn in your ballot! 
If Californians simply just Vote on Nov 8th, we can remove Gavin Newsom from office.
